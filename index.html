                    <P class="sections-text">Grand cafe Lochergut it is a beautiful place in which I learned all the basics for Kitchen Assistant and Dishwashing. 
                        A new experience I do really appreciate since I was able not only to learn a lot about how a kitchen and a restaurant 
                        work, but also feel how much passion and effort is in the kitchen. I am really thankful with my bosses and colleges 
                        that helped me a lot to learn and being consistent day by day!<br><br>
