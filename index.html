                        develop skills of: Leadership, Teamwork, Communication, Organization and Marketing. One of those projects was Fan 
                        Fest Sv, then I started my career in a different industry which was Customer Service and Tech Support.

                        Fan Fest El Salvador, was an idea that began as a result of a passion, Anime and Video Games. 
                        In order to carry out a healthy entertainment event for children and adults, it was necessary 
                        to organize and build a good work team and have excellent communication in order to not only 
                        complete this objective but also offer quality to the attending public.

                        In this event it was not easy to carry out all the content offered, in this case: Videogame 
                        tournaments, Concerts, Cosplay Contests, Product Stands and Food. The most difficult thing was 
                        to organize the arrival of our Special Guest: Cesar Franco, the Mexican singer of the Openings and 
                        Endings Latin version of our Favorite Anime series.
