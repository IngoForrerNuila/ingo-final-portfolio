                        My name is Ingo Pytheas Forrer Nuila. I was born in El Salvador, a country where 
                        I studied Graphic Design for 3 years and organized Entertainment events for the whole family. 
                        In this way, at the Freelance level, I was able to develop skills of: Leadership, Teamwork, 
                        Communication, Organization and Marketing. One of those projects was Fan Fest Sv, then I started
                        my career in a different industry which was Customer Service and Tech Support.

                    <p class="sections-text">
                        Fan Fest El Salvador, was an idea that began as a result of a passion, Anime and Video Games. 
                        In order to carry out a healthy entertainment event for children and adults, it was necessary 
                        to organize and build a good work team and have excellent communication in order to not only 
                        complete this objective but also offer quality to the attending public.

                        In this event it was not easy to carry out all the content offered, in this case: Videogame 
                        tournaments, Concerts, Cosplay Contests, Product Stands and Food. The most difficult thing was 
                        to organize the arrival of our Special Guest: Cesar Franco, the Mexican singer of the Openings and 
                        Endings Latin version of our Favorite Anime series.

                    <P class="sections-text">Grand cafe Lochergut it is a beautiful place in which I learned all the basics for Kitchen Assistant and Dishwashing. 
                        A new experience I do really appreciate since I was able not only to learn a lot about how a kitchen and a restaurant 
                        work, but also feel how much passion and effort is in the kitchen. I am really thankful with my bosses and colleges 
                        that helped me a lot to learn and being consistent day by day!<br><br>
