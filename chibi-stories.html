                    <p class="sections-text">
                        When the realization of a final project was proposed to me, then I immediately thought of creating something 
                        from scratch, a new product, something that people would like and that they could touch and feel. So I immediately 
                        thought of a comic, however a comic needed a lot of time to make, something I didn't count on, since my plan was not 
                        only to create the product physically, but also to transfer this product to a website. This is how the idea of 
                        creating a comic became a magazine with multiple sections that would aim to entertain and why not inform.

                    </p>

                    <p class="sections-text">
                        The ideas were still not clear, the comic had to present characters that would not take me so long to make but 
                        that would nevertheless be attractive to the public. Already at this stage of the project I was thinking of 
                        entertaining and educating a teenage audience and children. I then defined to make a comic under CHIBIS, a style of 
                        cartoons from Japan, it is a simple art although full of details and that should be extremely cool and friendly, my first 
                        objective then was to bring not only cute and fun adventures but also Useful reflections for boys and girls who wish 
                        to have pets at home.<br><br>

                        An extra goal for me was to create more interaction between the readers and the magazine, not only physically but also online. 
                        For this, I thought of creating different games apart from the comics and education sections. The creation of mazes, coloring 
                        sections and searching for hard-to-find visual elements hit the mark for kids to use their imagination and eyesight to complete 
                        the various challenges. Within the Website topic, I had to start thinking about something a little more radical, since the best 
                        way to create online games for kids is using Java Script, a programming language that is difficult to understand but with basic 
                        knowledge you can get codes free on the net and manipulate these JavaScript codes to make something beautiful for the project.<BR>

                    </p>
                                       
                </div>
                               
            </div>
                          
            <div class="section-container-2 col-xl">
                <div class="section-child">

                    <h1 class="sections-title"></h1>
                
                    
                    <h3 class="sections-title">A CLEAR VISION OF THE PROJECT MAGNITUDE</h3>
                    <p class="sections-text">The project must be defined as well as the different sections of the Web Page and should provide one:<br><br>

                        °Section to view the various magazines virtually.<br>
                        °Section to enjoy the various mini-games released.<br>
                        °Section to enjoy mini-episodes of our beloved Chibi-Friends.<br>
                        °Section to view the various special souvenirs.<br>
                        °Section to go deeper and learn more about the characters.<br><br>
                        
                        In this way I tried to be as creative as possible to solve these imposed goals, so in a short time I had to try to present not only the 
                        physical magazine but also the website of said magazine. For the digital presentation of the magazine, I used an image carousel with 
                        JavaScript, a free code that I found on the internet and that helped me learn about said language. For content such as mini-episodes, use 
                        Canva and AniMaker, a very useful combination given various exclusive tools per application.
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="sections-title"></h1>

                    <P class="sections-text">The minigame to draw your favorite characters from the magazine was one of the most difficult experiences for me, being basically 
                        a JavaScrip newbie. The code I found was a free code that within several communities was used for various applications. However, 
                        the code was full of errors and brought many problems for the objectives I had with my website, I had to study the code a lot, investigate 
                        a lot on the internet and finally come up with several solutions, this little mini-game being a resounding success, despite Many see it 
                        as something of little value, I see it as a great achievement, despite the fact that the code was not created by me from scratch, I am proud 
                        to have understood 60% of it and to be able to manipulate it at my convenience and in favor of my project.</P>
